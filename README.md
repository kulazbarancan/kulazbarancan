#About Myself üëã
-----------------------

My name is Baran Can Kulaz.

I graduated from the Arel University.

Currently, I work at Games United Ltd Sti. as a Senior Unity Developer.

In this role, I'm handaling server-side requirements, web APIs, and implemented game logics for a multiplayer casual mobile games.

In 2020, we founded BigPogo Games as a team of three and started working in the gaming industry for our own company. During this time, we developed 30+ hyper-casual games in collaboration with various publishers. This process lasted for about a year. At the end of the year, our company was acquired by Games United, and we joined the Games United family along with several other studios. Games United is an independent Digital Entertainment Content Factory with a distinct focus on mobile gaming. Founded in 2021 by experienced entrepreneurs, Games United secured $60M in investments from investors in January 2023.During my 4-year (and ongoing) journey with Games United, I have worked as a Lead Developer on 5 Hardcore | MidCore projects and several hyper-casual projects. I continue to contribute to our ongoing projects. Among these games, 4 were multiplayer titles, and I actively worked on their server, database, and game mechanics, leading and steering the projects. Additionally, I participated in product discussions on how to improve game mechanics and guided the art team in art optimization efforts.

Before joining Games United, I worked at BigPogo Games for proximetly 1 year or over a bit. 

My career began at NaturelMation in England, where I worked for more than 2.5 years in this studio for JuniorGame Developer. There, we developed many games for gaming endustrity. After graduating from university, I went to England to learn English and graduated from UFC Brighton, part of the Oxford Education Group. Prior to this, I was developing Form Applications with C#. However, my journey into game development began in Brighton when I encountered an opportunity in this field. After finishing school, I had to return to my country due to certain reasons. However, after returning, I continued working remotely with the same company about 1.5 more years.

Throughout my career, I have been working as a Senior Unity Developer with a primary focus on C#. But I also have extensive experience and knowledge in other areas such as JavaScript, SDK implementations, AR projects, Firebase (Auth, Realtime DB, Firestore, Analytics, etc.), Photon, DarkRift Networking, art optimizations, and PlayFab, having worked on numerous projects in these fields.

I've been developing mobile and console games professionally for over 7 years.

This is a brief summary of my software journey so far.
